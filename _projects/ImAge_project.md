The ImAge project introduces a novel approach to quantifying aging and rejuvenation through advanced image analysis techniques. Our method leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful features from cellular images, providing a robust measure of biological age.

The workflow consists of four main steps:

1. Illumination correction
2. Nuclei segmentation
3. Image feature extraction
4. ImAge axis construction

This comprehensive approach allows for accurate assessment of chromatin and epigenetic age, offering new insights into the aging process and potential rejuvenation strategies.

Our research has demonstrated the power and versatility of ImAge in various contexts, from basic research to potential clinical applications. The tool's ability to provide single-cell resolution of biological age opens up new avenues for studying aging heterogeneity within tissues and organisms.

The ImAge project is open-source and available on GitHub, encouraging collaboration and further development within the scientific community. We believe that this tool will contribute significantly to our understanding of aging processes and aid in the development of interventions to promote healthy aging.
