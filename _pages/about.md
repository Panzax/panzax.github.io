I aim to develop novel deep learning (DL) based approaches to capture and analyze information embedded within living systems. I hypothesize that understanding the spatio-temporal organization of biological elements will be integral to generating meaningful representations of cellular structure, function, dynamics, and interactions. Specifically, I hypothesize that the spatio-temporal organization of key elements in the cell's information processing machinery form a low dimensional state space, and that the operators which transform this state space along with the state space itself are learnable given the correct modeling approach and holistic datasets.

By combining computational methods with insights from the physical sciences, I aim to decode how cells organize and process information across multiple scales - from molecules to entire genomes and cellular networks. My research lies at the intersection of deep learning, artificial intelligence, and computational biology, driven by the vision that understanding the spatial organization of biological elements will unlock new insights into how cells operate and interact, and how we may use this knowledge to improve the well-being of conscious creatures.
