I'm learning to develop novel deep learning approaches to understand and extract information embedded within living systems, with a particular focus on integrating multi-modal biological data like microscopic images, spatial genomics, and epigenetic sequencing. By combining computational methods with insights from the physical sciences, I aim to decode how cells organize and process information across multiple scales - from individual molecules to entire genomes and cellular networks. My research lies at the intersection of deep learning, artificial intelligence, and computational biology, driven by the vision that understanding the spatial organization of biological information alongside sequence-level data will be key to quantifying cellular aging, pathology, and disease.
