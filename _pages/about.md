I am a PhD student at the [Center for Computational Biology](https://ccb.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley working jointly in the labs of [Eric Betzig](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/eric-betzig) and [Gokul Upadhyayula](https://mcb.berkeley.edu/faculty/cdb/upadhyayulas) on scaling spatio-temporal vision models trained via self-supervised learning at the [Advanced Bioimaging Center (ABC)](https://abc.berkeley.edu). I aim to use cutting edge deep vision models combined with emerging self-supervised learning methods to capture and analyze information embedded within and processed by living systems. I hypothesize that foundation models trained on the spatio-temporal organization of biological elements will be integral to generating meaningful representations of cellular structure, function, dynamics, and interactions. Specifically, I hypothesize that the essential aspects characterizing the spatio-temporal organization of subcellular elements can be captured by scaling large neural networks trained via self-supervised learning on nano-scale spatio-temporal data; and that these networks will then themselves become artifacts which we can study to understand biological dynamics. I suspect that these representations may also hold the key to falsifying emerging theories on self organization and the foundations of consciousness, agency, intelligence, and world modeling.
